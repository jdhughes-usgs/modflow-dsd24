    "## Description of the flow problem\n",
    "Consider radial flow in a confined, initially saline aquifer. The aquifer extends in the $r$ direction from $r=0$ to $r=R$, where $R$ is chosen far enough away not to effect the solution. Water is injected by the well at a rate $Q$. The head is fixed at $r=R$ to $h_R$. Flow is considered to be at steady state instantaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "The initial salt concentration is equal to $c_s$ everywhere. Injection of fresh water with concentration $c_f$ starts at $t=0$ and last for $t_\\text{in}$ days, after which water is extracted at the same rate $Q$ for $t_\\text{out}$ days. Injection and extraction are distributed equally across the layers, which is an approximation when buoyancy is taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "The density $\\rho$ of the water is approximated using the following linear relation:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\rho = \\frac{\\text{d}\\rho}{\\text{d}c}(c-c_\\text{ref}) + \\rho_\\text{ref}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "where the reference concentration is $c_\\text{ref}=0$ and the reference density is $\\rho_\\text{ref}=1000$ kg/m$^3$ (i.e., freshwater) and $\\frac{\\text{d}\\rho}{\\text{d}c}$ is the specified gradient such that a salinity of $c=35$ kg/m$^3$ (seawater) results in a density of 1025 kg/m$^3$. Here, the aquifer that is considered is brackish and has a salinity $c_s=20$ g/L, which is lower than seawater.\n",
    "\n",
    "Radial flow is simulated with a MODFLOW 6 model with one row (and multiple layers and columns, of course) using the approach of Langevin (2008). This means that the hydraulic conductivity $k$ and porosity $n$ are replaced by radialized versions $k_r$ and $n_r$ as\n",
